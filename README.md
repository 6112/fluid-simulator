# Fluid Simulator

A real-time, 2D fluid simulator written in Java. It allows basic user interaction with the mouse by clicking and dragging to "pick up" some of the fluid. Currently, this application can be used as a Java Applet.

It was made with Alexandre D'Amboise for my final project in CEGEP. This is why comments in the code are in French.
