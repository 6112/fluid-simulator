  <h1>Fluid Simulator</h1>

  <p>This Java program is a Swing application for simulating fluid physics. It
  was ported from a desktop application to an applet and, as a result, font
  rendering may be weird. It uses a particle system to mimic the appearance of
  a liquid inside a bottle.</p>

  <p>You can use your mouse to pick up the fluid, and change the direction of
  the gravity, and other settings, from the menu on the right.</p>

  <p>The color of the fluid indicates the pressure at a given point.</p>

  <p>If the demo does not work in your web browser, you may want to try the
  <a href="FluidSimulatorStandalone.jar">standalone .jar file</a></p>

  <applet id="simulator" code="RunApplet" archive="FluidSimulatorApplet.jar" 
    codebase="." width="700" height="450">
    <param name="permissions" value="sandbox" />
  </applet>

  <p>This project was made with the help of Alexandre D'Amboise.</p>
